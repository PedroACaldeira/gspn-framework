# GSPN Framework
Framework that allows the design, execution and analysis of generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPN).
The designed Petri net can be simulated, where the evolution of the net is updated at each transition. Furthermore, from the designed Petri net can be obtained the analogous coverability tree and continuous time Markov chain (CTMC), enabling a qualitative (logical) and quantitative (performace) analysis of the Petri net.
Moreover, it allows to import, to a python object, a Petri net designed in pipe 2.0 graphical tool (http://pipe2.sourceforge.net/).
